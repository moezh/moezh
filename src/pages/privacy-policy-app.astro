    <h2>Tracking technologies</h2>
    <h3>Cookies and Web Beacons</h3>
    <p>
      We may use cookies, web beacons, tracking pixels, and other tracking
      technologies on the Application to help customize the Application and
      improve your experience. When you access the Application, your personal
      information is not collected through the use of tracking technology. Most
      browsers are set to accept cookies by default. You can remove or reject
      cookies, but be aware that such action could affect the availability and
      functionality of the Application. You may not decline web beacons.
      However, they can be rendered ineffective by declining all cookies or by
      modifying your web browser's settings to notify you each time a cookie is
      tendered, permitting you to accept or decline cookies on an individual
      basis.
    </p>
    <h3>Internet-Based Advertising</h3>
    <p>
      Additionally, we may use third-party software to serve ads on the
      Application, implement email marketing campaigns, and manage other
      interactive marketing initiatives. This third-party software may use
      cookies or similar tracking technology to help manage and optimize your
      online experience with us. For more information about opting-out of
      interest-based ads, visit the Network Advertising Initiative Opt-Out Tool
      or Digital Advertising Alliance Opt-Out Tool.
    </p>
    <h3>Website Analytics</h3>
    <p>
      We may also partner with selected third-party vendors to allow tracking
      technologies and remarketing services on the Application through the use
      of first party cookies and third-party cookies, to, among other things,
      analyze and track users' use of the Application, determine the popularity
      of certain content, and better understand online activity. By accessing
      the Application, you consent to the collection and use of your information
      by these third-party vendors. You are encouraged to review their privacy
      policy and contact them directly for responses to your questions. We do
      not transfer personal information to these third-party vendors.
    </p>
    <p>
      You should be aware that getting a new computer, installing a new browser,
      upgrading an existing browser, or erasing or otherwise altering your
      browser's cookies files may also clear certain opt-out cookies, plug-ins,
      or settings.
    </p>
    <h2>Third-party websites</h2>
    <p>
      The Application may contain links to third-party websites and applications
      of interest, including advertisements and external services, that are not
      affiliated with us. Once you have used these links to leave the
      Application, any information you provide to these third parties is not
      covered by this Privacy Policy, and we cannot guarantee the safety and
      privacy of your information. Before visiting and providing any information
      to any third-party websites, you should inform yourself of the privacy
      policies and practices (if any) of the third party responsible for that
      website, and should take those steps necessary to, in your discretion,
      protect the privacy of your information. We are not responsible for the
      content or privacy and security practices and policies of any third
      parties, including other sites, services or applications that may be
      linked to or from the Application.
    </p>
    <h2>Security of your information</h2>
    <p>
      We use administrative, technical, and physical security measures to help
      protect your personal information. While we have taken reasonable steps to
      secure the personal information you provide to us, please be aware that
      despite our efforts, no security measures are perfect or impenetrable, and
      no method of data transmission can be guaranteed against any interception
      or other type of misuse. Any information disclosed online is vulnerable to
      interception and misuse by unauthorized parties. Therefore, we cannot
      guarantee complete security if you provide personal information.
    </p>
    <h2>Policy for children</h2>
    <p>
      We do not knowingly solicit information from or market to children under
      the age of 13. If you become aware of any data we have collected from
      children under age 13, please contact us using the contact information
      provided below.
    </p>
    <h2>Controls for do-not-track features</h2>
    <p>
      Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems include a Do-Not-Track
      (“DNT”) feature or setting you can activate to signal your privacy
      preference not to have data about your online browsing activities
      monitored and collected. No uniform technology standard for recognizing
      and implementing DNT signals has been finalized. As such, we do not
      currently respond to DNT browser signals or any other mechanism that
      automatically communicates your choice not to be tracked online. If a
      standard for online tracking is adopted that we must follow in the future,
      we will inform you about that practice in a revised version of this
      Privacy Policy.
    </p>
